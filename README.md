# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Comparison
We provide a very simple demo which used several machine learning algorithms to deal with a movie sentiment classification task and compared their performance.

## Algorithm model involved

1. SVM
2. Naive Bayes
3. Logistic Regression
4. KNN
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. AdaBoost
8. XGBoost
9. MLP

## Dependent packages
1. scikit-learin (â‰¥ 0.20)
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. joblib
5. xgboost

## How to use
1. Comment out the 'model_parameters'(but save '{}' in each element) to get the baseline model for each algorithm;
2. You need to change all 'dir_path' that appear in the processor.py according to your File Directory.
